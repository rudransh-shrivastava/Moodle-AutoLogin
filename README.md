# Moodle Auto Login Plugin

- This Plugin Automatically logs you into moodle, yes it's a pain when moodle auto logs you out...

- For now this plugin is only available for firefox, chrome users will have to wait a few days for me to make it compatible with chrome :)

- I am waiting for the plugin to be approved by the firefox team before adding a url for the download

- This plugin only works with the MITS Gwalior Moodle for now, other moodle websites will be supported in the later versions(open an issue if you want me to do that).

## How to Setup?

- Simply visit moodle.mitsgwalior.in
- Click on Login
- You will be redirected to the extension page
- Fill the Details and click Save Info
- Close the Page
- Done! From now on everytime you click on the Login Button from the moodle page you will be auto logged in.
